      question: 'How Does Loan Settlement Work?',
      answer:
        'Loan settlement is like negotiating with the people you owe money to. Instead of paying back the whole amount, you might talk to them and agree on a lower sum. For example, you owe Rs. 2,00,000 on your credit card. Through negotiation, you could end up settling the debt for Rs. 1,00,000. This way, the creditor gets some money, and you don’t have to deal with the full debt anymore. It’s a good outcome for both sides.',
